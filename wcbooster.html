    <h3>Webcam booster shim thingy</h3>
    <p>I have had a bit of a problem. My webcam front fin is long enough it hangs past the bevel section of my monitor.
        It leaves an iPhone-esque notch pattern blocking the view. I have put up with this for years and decided to stick
        something underneith it to raise it up out of the way (vs cutting the fin down).</p>

        <h4>Picture of the problem</h4>

        alt="image of the problem, showing webcam covering monitor where it sits" >
        

    <p>Much to my surprise, I didnt have anything of the appropriate size to simply stick under it. So of course,
        I measured it. 
        <p>Measurements:
            <ul>
                <li>top of the monitor width: 15mm</li>
                <li>webcam landing area: 45mmx50mm deep.</li>
                <li>overhang: 5mm for my monitor bezel</li>
            </ul>
    so a 40x10x5mm (wxdxh) rectangle should do the trick.
    20 minutes creating a rectangle with two constraints in FreeCAD, which would have taken
    someone who's used the software before 0.1 seconds. <em>Extremely</em> advanced stuff here!</p>
    <h5>Ultra extreme FreeCAD design</h5>

    <h5>Then I sliced it.. </h5>

    <h5>and printed it.. </h5>

    <p>Took a whopping 8 minutes as you could imagine.
        <aside>I love this ultra cheap ($200 at the time) FLsun Q5 delta printer</aside>

    <h5>Success</h5>

    <p>Sometimes it feels good to overkill fix the small stuff</p>

    <p>The source files (freecad project, stl, and gcode - 20% infill 0.20mm) are 
        <a href="https://media.dmh.fm/wcbooster/wcbooster.zip">here</a>
         if anyone has same webcam and wants to save time 
        with the base measurements</p>
